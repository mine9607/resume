  <h2>SUMMARY</h2><hr/>
    <p><font size="4">
      An experienced petroleum engineer with over 12 years in production operations and reservoir management of
      unconventional onshore petroleum systems. I am seeking to combine my technical aptitude and passion to transition
      into a career in web development. I hope to create practical, cost-effective software solutions for small-scale
      energy producers and to bring innovative solutions to the coffee industry - helping promote transparency,
      sustainability, and profitability for coffee farmers and their families.</p>
